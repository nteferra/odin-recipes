                <ul>
                    <li>1 3/4 lbs ground chuck</li>
                    <li>Olive oil</li>
                    <li>1 large red onion</li>
                    <li>1 splash, white wine vinegar</li>
                    <li>1 pinch salt and pepper</li>
                    <li>2 large gherkins</li>
                    <li>4 sesame-topped brioche burger buns</li>
                    <li>4-8 slices of smoked bacon</li>
                    <li>Tabasco chipotle sauce</li>
                    <li>4 tsp yellow mustard</li>
                    <li>4 thin slices of Red Leicester cheese</li>
                    <li>4 tsp ketchup</li>
                </ul>

                <h3>Steps</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>For the best burger, go to your butcher and ask them to grind 1 3/4 lbs of chuck steak for you. 
                        This cut has a really good balance of fat and flavorsome meat. Divide it into 4 and, with wet hands, 
                        roll each piece into a ball, then press into flat patties roughly 5 inches wide and about 3/4 inch 
                        wider than your buns. Place on an oiled plate and chill in the fridge. Next, finely slice the red onion, 
                        then dress in a bowl with the vinegar and a pinch of sea salt. Slice the gherkins and halve the buns. 
                        Finely chop the lettuce and mix with the rest of the burger sauce ingredients in a bowl, then season to taste.</li>

                        <li>I like to cook only 2 burgers at a time to achieve perfection, so get two pans on the go—a large non-stick frying 
                        pan on a high heat for your burgers and another on a medium heat for the bacon. Pat your burgers with oil and 
                        season them with salt and pepper. Put 2 burgers into the first pan, pressing down on them with a slotted spatula, 
                        then put half the bacon into the other pan. After 1 minute, flip the burgers and brush each cooked side with a 
                        1/2 teaspoon of mustard and a dash of Tabasco. After another minute, flip onto the mustard side and brush again with 
                        another 1/2 teaspoon of mustard and a second dash of Tabasco on the other side. Cook for 1 more minute, by which point 
                        you can place some crispy bacon on top of each burger with a slice of cheese. Add a tiny splash of water to the pan and 
                        place a heatproof bowl over the burgers to melt the cheese—30 seconds should do it. At the same time, toast 2 split buns 
                        in the bacon fat in the other pan until lightly golden. Repeat with the remaining 2 burgers.</li>

                        <li>To build each burger, add a quarter of the burger sauce to the bun base, then top with a cheesy bacon burger, a quarter 
                        of the onions, and gherkins. Rub the bun top with a teaspoon of ketchup, then gently press together. As the burger rests, 
                        juices will soak into the bun, so serve right away, which is great, or for an extra-naughty experience, wrap each one in 
                        parchment paper, then give it a minute to get gorgeous and sloppy.</li>
