                   <li>4 garlic cloves, minced</li>
                   <li>24 oz ground beef</li>
                   <li>10 oz ground pork</li>
                   <li>24 oz passata</li>
                   <li>14 oz crushed tomatoes</li>
                   <li>3 tbsp tomto paste</li>
                   <li>2 bouillon cubes</li>
                   <li>1 tsp each dried oregano and basil</li>
                   <li>salt and pepper</li> 
                </ul>

                <h3>Steps</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Heat oil in a large pot over medium heat, then add in the onion and carrots and cook for 8-10 minutes, 
                        or until softened. Add in the garlic and saut√© for about 1 minute, until fragrant.</li>
                        
                        <li>Add beef and pork (if using) and cook while breaking it up with the end of your spoon, until browned.</li>

                        <li>Pour in the Passata, crushed tomatoes, tomato paste, crushed bouillon and dried herbs. 
                            Mix well to combine and bring to a gentle simmer. Season with desired amount of salt and pepper 
                            (I use about 3/4 teaspoon each) and sugar if needed. Cover and cook for about 20-30 minutes, occasionally 
                            mixing, until the sauce has thickened slightly and meat is tender.</li>
                        
                        <li>Adjust salt, pepper and dried herbs to your taste.</li>
                    </ol>
